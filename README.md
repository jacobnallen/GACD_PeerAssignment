Peer Graded Assignment - Getting & Cleaning Data

Files
- [CodeBook.md] describes the variables and actions to transform and create the tidy data set
- [run_analysis.R] is the function required by the assignment; it outlines and follows the 5 steps of the assigned task:
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- [final_data.txt] is the final tidydata output after going through the functions above
